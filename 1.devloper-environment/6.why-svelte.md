# Why build mini apps in Svelte and not any other framework?

- **Small bundle size:** A critical issue with mini-apps is bundle sizes with a svelte base bundle size ( 2kb ) you simply could achieve a full-featured mini app with less than 50kb and in best cases will be 25kb if the mini app is built with good architecture the bundles will be tiny as possible.
- **memory efficient:**  Svelte is almost identical to pure js performance and not unlike react or angular where they consume a lot of memory without any known reason
- **Simplicity:** Svelte is very simple to learn and includes a lot of features out of the box
- **Error handling:** Svelte includes a robust way to handle errors, memory leaks, and other issues you might face with other frameworks
- **State management:** Svelte includes store state management out of the box.
- **Full features**: Built-in scoped styling, state management, motion primitives, form bindings, and more â€” don't waste time trawling npm for the bare essentials. It's all here.
