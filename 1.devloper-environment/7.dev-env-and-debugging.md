### Network 
A network logger that show all the request from the mini app and show what is happening to make it easier for development and for testing bugs later that might happen in production

### Logger 
Monkey patching the original consol.log and integrating logger inside the mini app will be a great way to investigate and debug your app 

### Super Logger
implement JsApi from the super so you can easily test and get tokens for auth without to implement it in your own mini app 

> The above 3 are a must to have as debugger which will be a huge deal for developers
