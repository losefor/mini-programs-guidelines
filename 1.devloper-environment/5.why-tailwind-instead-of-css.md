- **It’s tiny — never ship unused CSS:** Tailwind automatically removes all unused CSS when building for production If you want to ship the best performant project tailwind is your choice.
- **tailwind obfuscator:** it is sometimes called a mangler it works with Webpack and Vite projects 
- **Consistent Design System:** Utility classes help you work within the constraints of a system instead of littering your stylesheets with arbitrary values with a design system you will be writing fewer classes which means less space.
